# Project 2 Proposal - Nelson

### Topic: Best States to Live Based on 50 Years Data

+ Taking a new approach to analyze and present a classical question asked by many people before us.
+ Provide interactive charts to allow users exam state data in 5 dimensions and see the trends:
    + unemployment rate
    + crime rate
    + population
    + classification of state
    + years

### Dataset

+ [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/lau/rdscnp16.htm)
+ [Uniform Crime Reporting Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/ucrdata/Search/Crime/State/StatebyState.cfm?NoVariables=Y&CFID=247193930&CFTOKEN=b6105fea0ed761eb-FDFE448E-D159-1EA8-A5EFE168BA588D99)

### Inspiring visualizations

+ [The Wealth & Health of Nations](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/)

+ [Drug adverse events](https://openfda-visualization.firebaseapp.com/#/)

### Sketch of design:

+ In the left side (2/3 of page) create a scatter plot for state data over 50 years, allow animation with a play button (similar to the wealth & health chart)
+ In the right side (1/3 of page) create a bar chart or pie chart when the user click on any specific state for a particular year on the left chart.  Add animations and transitions similar to the drug adverse events chart
+ If time allows, add a US 50 state map on a seperate page.  When a user clicks on the bar chart or pie chart, it will redirect to the map page and highlight the state selected, and display some interesting information about the selected state.
